      <h2>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Victor Kilel, and I am a student at <a href="https://www.moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a>. I hope to pursue a double-major in Computer Science and Physics once I am through with Moringa School, and furthur hone my programming skills. I love inter-disciplinary approach to education, and I believe coding is a vital skill that everyone should have regardless of their career field.</p>
      <p>I decided to take programming classes at Moringa School because I believe technology can better human lives immensely. I have always wanted to be a better community member and I want to better situations around me by fostering technological progress in my community.</p>
